# solidity-task-liquality

Hi,

I developed smart contract with Solidity and tested with Hardhat and Ethers.
And also, I used openzeppelin for re-entrancy guard.

Here is the links.

- [Smart Contract](https://github.com/unipine/solidity-task-liquality/blob/main/contracts/Payment.sol)

- [Test](https://github.com/unipine/solidity-task-liquality/blob/main/test/test.ts)

Thank you for your time.

Have a nice day.
